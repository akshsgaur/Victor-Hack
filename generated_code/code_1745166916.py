    Implements a simplified version of the flash attention mechanism for demonstration purposes.
    This function computes the attention scores and applies them to the value vectors.

    - query: A tensor of shape (batch_size, query_length, dimensions) representing the query vectors.
    - key: A tensor of shape (batch_size, key_length, dimensions) representing the key vectors.
    - value: A tensor of shape (batch_size, key_length, dimensions) representing the value vectors.
